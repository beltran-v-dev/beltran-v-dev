  <h4>I'm an enthusiastic Game Developer passionate about technology. I've participated as a project manager and as a programmer in two projects in Unity: 'Element Killer' and 'Catch it!'. Currently, I'm more focused on Unreal Engine. I've completed a small project aimed at helping me feel more confident working with Unreal Engine Blueprints ‚Äì it's a samurai combat game, and you should definitely check it out.

Currently, I'm working on an Unreal Engine project where I'm trying to write as much code as I can in C++. The project is titled 'Hospital Project', and the main theme revolves around our main character finding her way out of a hospital crawling with zombies. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?

### Project I've worked on üßê

- Element Killer: Element Killer is a 2D platform video game in which our main character has to defeat different enemies and reach the end of the level. To do so, the player has to combine different elements such as fire, water, and plant to complete the level in just over a minute.
