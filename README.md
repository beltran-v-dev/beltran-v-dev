  <h4 align="left">I'm an enthusiastic game developer with a passion for video games that carry powerful messages. I've participated as a project manager and as a programmer in two projects in Unity: 'Element Killer' and 'Catch it!'. Currently, I'm more focused on Unreal Engine. I've completed a small project aimed at helping me feel more confident working with Unreal Engine Blueprints ‚Äì it's a samurai combat game, and you should definitely check it out.

  <h4 align="left"> At the moment, I'm working on an Unreal Engine project where I'm trying to write as much code as I can in C++. The project is titled 'Hospital Project', and the main theme revolves around our main character finding her way out of a hospital crawling with zombies. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?

### Project I've worked on üßê

- Element Killer: Element Killer is a 2D platform video game in which our main character has to defeat different enemies and reach the end of the level. To do so, the player has to combine different elements such as fire, water, and plant to complete the level in just over a minute.

  Do you want to play it?

- Catch It!: Catch It! is an online video game PVP. You can choose between two teams: the dog team or the cat team. The main objective is to pick up the item you'll see at the opposing team's base and bring it to your base. To win, you should steal their item and bring it to your base 3 times. If you want to prevent your opponent from picking up your item, you can shoot them and try to kill them.

  Take a look at it!

- Samurai Project: It's a small project where my objective was to feel more confident working with Unreal Engine Blueprints. In this project, I worked on the fundamentals of AI behavior trees, character movement, controlling combat characters, and animations.

  Take a look at it!

### My love for Unreal Engine Materials üåà
  
- Snow never falls: To achieve this, I have used a technique called Triplanar Mapping. Three material functions have been used to create the rock part, the snow part, and the Triplanar Mapping

 - Lake: To achieve the creation of the water material, I have worked with nodes that help us to measure the distance to create the foam, I have worked with different normal maps and how to mix them, I  have worked with the panner node, also the texture coordinate node so that the different textures have different uvs and look more realistic. We have also worked with a height map to create a slight tide, we are not in the sea, but it will be subtle and will give more life, I have worked with the height Lerp node and with the pixel depth and scene colour nodes among others.

 - Landscape Project A: This was the first attempt to create a material autolandscape, I used PixelDepth to control the tiling between different textures,
employed different textures with various UVs, a macro texture variation to avoid even more repetition between textures, and in this project, I decided to use the WorldAlignedBlend node in order to create a bleen between texutres more realistic, although using this node I don't have as much control as I would like.

 
    Appart from that, I used assets from Megascans and Lumen to improve the final scene
