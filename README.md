I'm an enthusiastic Game Developer passionate about technology. I've participated as a project manager and as a programmer in two projects in Unity: 'Element Killer' and 'Catch it!'. Currently, I'm more focused on Unreal Engine. I've completed a small project aimed at helping me feel more confident working with Unreal Engine Blueprints ‚Äì it's a samurai combat game, and you should definitely check it out.
