  <h4>I'm an enthusiastic Game Developer passionate about technolog, I've participated as a project managar and as a programmer 
  in two projects in Unity; Element Killer and Catch it!, Currenty I'm more focused on Unreal Eninge, I've done a
  small project where my objective was to feel more confident working with Unreal Engine Blueprints, it's a samurai combat, you should
  check it out. Now I'm working on a Unreal Engine project where I'm trying to write as much as I can in c++, the prjoect is called 
  Hospital project and the main theme is that our main character will have to find her way out of a hospital crawling with zombies. 
  Sounds exciting, doesn't it?
