- ***Catch It!***: Catch It! is an online video game PVP. You can choose between two teams: the dog team or the cat team. The main objective is to pick up the item you'll see at the opposing team's base and bring it to your base. To win, you should steal their item and bring it to your base 3 times. If you want to prevent your opponent from picking up your item, you can shoot them and try to kill them.

  Take a look at it!
