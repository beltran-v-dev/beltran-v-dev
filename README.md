I'm an enthusiastic Game Developer passionate about technology. I've participated as a project manager and as a programmer in two projects in Unity: 'Element Killer' and 'Catch it!'. Currently, I'm more focused on Unreal Engine. I've completed a small project aimed at helping me feel more confident working with Unreal Engine Blueprints ‚Äì it's a samurai combat game, and you should definitely check it out.

Currently, I'm working on an Unreal Engine project where I'm trying to write as much code as I can in C++. The project is titled 'Hospital Project', and the main theme revolves around our main character finding her way out of a hospital crawling with zombies. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?
