  <h4 align="left"> Currently, I'm working on an Unreal Engine project where I'm trying to write as much code as I can in C++. The project is titled 'Hospital Project', and the main theme revolves around our main character finding her way out of a hospital crawling with zombies. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?

### Project I've worked on üßê

- Element Killer: Element Killer is a 2D platform video game in which our main character has to defeat different enemies and reach the end of the level. To do so, the player has to combine different elements such as fire, water, and plant to complete the level in just over a minute.

  Do you want to play it?

- Catch It!: Catch It! is an online video game PVP. You can choose between two teams: the dog team or the cat team. The main objective is to pick up the item you'll see at the opposing team's base and bring it to your base. To win, you should steal their item and bring it to your base 3 times. If you want to prevent your opponent from picking up your item, you can shoot them and try to kill them.

  Take a look at it!

- Samurai Project: It's a small project where my objective was to feel more confident working with Unreal Engine Blueprints. In this project, I worked on the fundamentals of AI behavior trees, character movement, controlling combat characters, and animations.

  Take a look at it!
